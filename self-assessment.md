# Development Experience
Most of my expierence and comfort is in the Microsoft stack.  I am very comfortable writing C# in Web Forms, MVC, or Web API.  I'm less skilled on the front end side of things, but can write vanilla JavaScript as well as Angular; HTML and CSS as well.
* C# is a multi-purpose, object orriented programming language created by Microsoft.  It is used by many companies world wide.
* Web Forms is a web application framework created by Microsoft.  It is older and therefore not as popular, but I'm sure many companies still use it today.
* MVC is allso a web application framework created by Microsoft.  It is still widely used by many developers.  As one would expect, it implements the Model-View-Controller pattern.
